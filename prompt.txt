Quick Commerce Platform

A company named FlashKart is launching a Quick Commerce platform focused on 10–20 minute delivery for groceries, daily essentials, and snacks in metro cities.
FlashKart operates using dark stores (micro-fulfillment centers) located across cities. Each dark store services a limited geographic radius and maintains real-time inventory.
The company expects rapid growth and wants a scalable, resilient, cloud-native architecture that can support future expansion into new categories and cities.


Context

FlashKart is a hyperlocal quick commerce company operating across multiple metro cities, focused on delivering groceries, daily essentials, and instant-consumption products within 10–20 minutes.
Today, FlashKart operates through a network of dark stores (micro-fulfillment centers) and independent delivery partners. However, the current ecosystem is fragmented and operationally inefficient. Inventory data is not always real-time, order allocation relies on partial manual intervention, and delivery partner assignment lacks dynamic optimization. During peak hours, flash sales, and festival events, these limitations result in inventory mismatches, delayed deliveries, order cancellations, and inconsistent customer experience.
To address these challenges, FlashKart plans to build a modern, cloud-native quick commerce platform capable of supporting millions of consumers, hundreds of dark stores, and thousands of delivery partners across cities.
The platform must allow customers to discover products based on their location, view real-time inventory availability, place orders in seconds, and track deliveries live from confirmation to doorstep. Orders should be automatically routed to the nearest eligible dark store, ensuring adherence to the 10–20 minute delivery SLA.
FlashKart also wants to support dynamic pricing, promotions, surge traffic handling, and peak-load events, while maintaining high inventory accuracy and fulfillment reliability. Delivery partners must be onboarded, assigned, and re-assigned in real time based on availability, proximity, capacity, and workload.
To enable this, the platform must integrate tightly with inventory management systems, dark store operations, payment gateways, delivery partner systems, notification services, and analytics platforms. The solution should be highly scalable, resilient to partial failures, observable, and capable of handling sudden traffic spikes without degrading customer experience.
This initiative aims to reduce order fulfillment time, eliminate inventory discrepancies, improve delivery reliability, and enable rapid city-by-city expansion, positioning FlashKart as a leading player in the quick commerce market.
